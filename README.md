# Crazy Dan's Furniture Emporium

Load up the list of furniture into the `ul` element.

When a piece of furniture is clicked on, add that furniture's details to the form in the `furniture-inspection` area.

If furniture has been selected, change the styling of that furniture's `li` element so we know it's been selected (the styling is up to you).

When the form is submitted, patch the furniture in the db.json and deselect the furniture. If you've changed that furniture's name, make sure the name changes in the front end as well.

BONUS: When the furniture gets fetched and every time that the furniture updates, order the list by price starting with the most expensive item and ending with the least expensive.
